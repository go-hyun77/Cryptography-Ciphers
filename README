-Executing the program:
1) Open a terminal and type "make" without the quotations.
2) type "./cipher <cipher name> <key> <enc/dec> <input file> <output file>"
        ->type the line above without the quotes, and fill in all the angle
        brackets and remove the angle brackets.

Extra Credit:
Our group did not have time to attempt the extra credit.

Note: This is the re-submit addressing the lack of output from the Vigenere and Playfair ciphers, 
      the PrintMatrix() function in the Playfair.h file was not implemented; the Playfair matrix
      is printed with a simple nested for loop upon decryption.
